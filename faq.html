    <h1 id="heading">THE FAQs EVERY CLEANING BUSINESS NEED</h1>
    <div class="head-para">
        <ul>
            <li id="list">
                <strong><h2>1. What types of cleaning services do you offer?</h2></strong>
                <p id="para">This is a big question for several consumers. And yes, you do have to answer it here in addition to listing everything on your services page. Don’t just use this question to link people to your services. Instead, explain all the cleaning that you offer in brief, as well as if you provide custom cleaning services or quotes. Only then will you invite them to check out your services page or contact you for additional information. 
                    Too often, brands use their FAQ to redirect people back to the other areas of their website withoutactually providing a lot of value on the FAQ page itself. That’s the wrong way to go about this.You can list services, explain them in sentences, or even just tell people that you handle allkinds of house cleaning and can fulfill their needs and invite them to contact you. </p>
            </li>
            <li id="list">
                <strong><h2>2. Do you offer weekly (or ongoing) cleaning contracts?</h2></strong>
                <p id="para">Most people want more than a one-time cleaning service. Usually, clients want regular cleaning services, or they may hire a professional cleaner to handle yearly deep cleaning like windows, cleaning walls and fans, and so forth. Answering this question ensures that your audience knows what you have to offer so that they can decide what they need. If you offer different terms for your contracts, such as the option between weekly and monthly cleaning, list them all here. In the event you offer custom cleaning contracts, explain that as well.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="list">
                <strong><h2>3. How long have you been in business?</h2></strong>
                <p id="para">Cleaning isn’t heart surgery, but it does involve letting strangers into your home to deliver a service. You can understand how people would want to know that they’re working with a reputable, professional cleaning service that has the necessary expertise to deliver the best results for their cleaning needs. People also want to be sure that you didn’t just start a business yesterday because while all newcompanies do deserve a chance, it can be difficult to work with cleaning services that are justgetting started. In addition to explaining your background and expertise here, invite people tocontact you for a consult or to discuss all the ways you can assist them with cleaning, regardlessof your experience or years in the business.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="list">
                <strong><h2>4. Do you have insurance?</h2></strong>
                <p id="para">Cleaning services go into people’s homes and touch their personal belongings. They work with chemicals, soap and water, and often ladders or stepladders to reach high spaces. There is a lot of potential for injury or other issues to arise on the job, even for the most experienced and reputable cleaning service. That’s why you buy (and maintain) insurance that protects your company and your clients from liability related to injuries or other incidents when you are in someone’s home or on their property. Pro Tip: Cleaners generally need Professional or Public Liability Coverage, which both fall uthe general liability category, as well as Business Personal Property coverage (BPP). If you emanyone, you’ll also need Workers’ Compensation insurance.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="list">
                <strong><h2>5. What are your fees and rates like?</h2></strong>
                <p id="para">Yes, we know that you have a services and rates page on your website. Your audience probably knows, too. However, it’s much easier to ask the question and see what comes up in the search results for FAQs. You need to disclose rates here, or at least as much information as you can about them. Explain how you charge, what the cost range for your services typically is, and how you can customize quotes and provide estimates for people on a case-by-case basis. It will also benefit you to link to your pricing page here and invite people to contact youmore information.</p>
